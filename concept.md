# Scope Mate: Framework for Strategic Decision Making

A CLI tool for breaking down complex tasks into smaller subtasks with LLM-powered scope estimation and planning.

## ðŸ§­ Purpose â†’ Strategic Relevance

**"Why does this matter now?"**

- Is it aligned with a company priority, customer need, or mission-critical goal?
- If we didn't do it, would anything break or stall?
- Does this move us closer to where we want to be?

> **âœ… If not strategic, it's a distraction.**

## ðŸ“¦ Scope â†’ Executable Shape

**"Can we actually do this â€” fast and clearly?"**

- Is it defined tightly enough to start today or this week?
- Can one person or squad own it end-to-end?
- What's the smallest useful version we can ship?

> **âœ… If it's vague or sprawling, it needs slicing.**

## ðŸŽ¯ Outcome â†’ Meaningful Result

**"What will change once this is done?"**

- Will this give us clarity, value, or unlock something else?
- How will we measure success â€” learning, delivery, or stability?
- What does "done" look like in a way others can see?

> **âœ… If the outcome is fuzzy, stop and clarify.**
