# 🪜 scopemate

A CLI tool for breaking down complex tasks into smaller subtasks with LLM-powered scope estimation and planning.

## Conceptual Framework

Scopemate is built around a three-part framework for strategic decision making:

### 🧭 Purpose → Strategic Relevance

**"Why does this matter now?"**

- Is it aligned with a company priority, customer need, or mission-critical goal?
- If we didn't do it, would anything break or stall?
- Does this move us closer to where we want to be?

> **✅ If not strategic, it's a distraction.**

### 📦 Scope → Executable Shape

**"Can we actually do this — fast and clearly?"**

- Is it defined tightly enough to start today or this week?
- Can one person or squad own it end-to-end?
- What's the smallest useful version we can ship?

> **✅ If it's vague or sprawling, it needs slicing.**

### 🎯 Outcome → Meaningful Result

**"What will change once this is done?"**

- Will this give us clarity, value, or unlock something else?
- How will we measure success — learning, delivery, or stability?
- What does "done" look like in a way others can see?

> **✅ If the outcome is fuzzy, stop and clarify.**

##### macOS/Linux
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

##### Windows Command Prompt
```cmd
set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

##### Windows PowerShell
```powershell
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
```

### Selecting LLM Provider

You can select which LLM provider to use by setting the `SCOPEMATE_LLM_PROVIDER` environment variable:

#### macOS/Linux
```bash
# Use OpenAI (default)
export SCOPEMATE_LLM_PROVIDER=OPENAI

# Use Gemini
export SCOPEMATE_LLM_PROVIDER=GEMINI

# Use Claude
export SCOPEMATE_LLM_PROVIDER=CLAUDE
```

#### Windows Command Prompt
```cmd
# Use OpenAI (default)
set SCOPEMATE_LLM_PROVIDER=OPENAI

# Use Gemini
set SCOPEMATE_LLM_PROVIDER=GEMINI

# Use Claude
set SCOPEMATE_LLM_PROVIDER=CLAUDE
```

#### Windows PowerShell
```powershell
# Use OpenAI (default)
$env:SCOPEMATE_LLM_PROVIDER = "OPENAI"

# Use Gemini
$env:SCOPEMATE_LLM_PROVIDER = "GEMINI"

# Use Claude
$env:SCOPEMATE_LLM_PROVIDER = "CLAUDE"
```

### Selecting Model

You can also specify which model to use for each provider:

```bash
# OpenAI model (default is o4-mini)
export SCOPEMATE_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo

# Gemini model (default is gemini-flash)
export SCOPEMATE_GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash

# Claude model (default is claude-3-haiku-20240307)
export SCOPEMATE_CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219
```

For permanent setup, add these environment variables to your shell profile or system environment variables.

## Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run in interactive mode (recommended for first-time users)
scopemate --interactive
```

### Command-line Options

```bash
# Get help and see all available options
scopemate --help

# Generate a project plan with purpose and outcome
scopemate --purpose="Build a REST API for user management" --outcome="A documented API with authentication and user CRUD operations" --output="project_plan.json"
```

**Note:** A Markdown version of the output is automatically generated alongside the JSON file. For example, if you specify `--output="project_plan.json"`, a file named `project_plan.md` will also be created.

### Interactive Mode Workflow

The interactive mode (`scopemate --interactive`) will guide you through:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Create a new task or load an existing plan
   - Set the main purpose and intended outcome

2. **Task Definition**:
   - Define the scope of work
   - Set dependencies and identify risks
   - Define acceptance criteria

3. **Task Breakdown**:
   - Automatically break down complex tasks into manageable subtasks
   - Review and modify suggested breakdowns
   - Explore alternative approaches to solving the problem

4. **Validation and Refinement**:
   - Automatically detect and fix inconsistent time estimates
   - Check for tasks where children take more time than parents
   - Adjust parent scope estimates based on child complexity

5. **Save and Export**:
   - Save your plan to a JSON file
   - Resume work later using checkpoints

### Output Format

scopemate generates both JSON and Markdown output files:

1. **JSON Output** - Structured data format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "TASK-abc123",
      "title": "Task title",
      "purpose": {
        "detailed_description": "Why this task matters",
        "alignment": ["Strategic goal 1", "Strategic goal 2"],
        "urgency": "strategic"
      },
      "scope": {
        "size": "complex",
        "time_estimate": "sprint",
        "dependencies": ["Dependency 1"],
        "risks": ["Risk 1", "Risk 2"]
      },
      "outcome": {
        "type": "customer-facing",
        "detailed_outcome_definition": "What will be delivered",
        "acceptance_criteria": ["Criterion 1", "Criterion 2"],
        "metric": "Success measurement",
        "validation_method": "How to validate"
      },
      "meta": {
        "status": "backlog",
        "priority": 1,
        "created": "2023-06-01T12:00:00Z",
        "updated": "2023-06-01T12:00:00Z",
        "due_date": null,
        "confidence": "medium"
      },
      "parent_id": null
    }
  ]
}
```

2. **Markdown Output** - Human-readable format automatically generated with the same basename as the JSON file. The Markdown output includes:
   - A summary of the plan with task counts and complexity breakdown
   - Hierarchical task structure preserving parent-child relationships
   - All relevant task details formatted for easy reading
   - Properly formatted sections for purpose, scope, outcome, and metadata

This dual output approach makes it easy to both process the data programmatically (using the JSON) and share the plan with team members (using the Markdown).

### Integrating with Other Tools

You can use scopemate's JSON output with other project management tools:

- Import tasks into JIRA using their API
- Convert to CSV for import into spreadsheets
- Integrate with custom project dashboards
